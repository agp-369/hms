    <h2>About Hospital</h2>
   <p>The Hospital Management System (HMS) is designed for Any Hospital
     to replace their existing manual, paper based system. The new system
      is to control the following information; patient information, room 
      availability, staff and operating room schedules, and patient invoices. 
      These services are to be provided in an efficient, cost effective manner, 
      with the goal of reducing the time and resources currently required for such 
      tasks.
    A significant part of the operation of any hospital involves the acquisition,
     management and timely retrieval of great volumes of information. This information 
     typically involves; patient personal information and medical history, staff information, 
     room and ward scheduling, staff scheduling, operating theater scheduling and various facilities
      waiting lists. All of this information must be managed in an efficient and cost wise fashion so that 
      an institution's resources may be effectively utilized HMS will automate the management of the hospital 
      making it more efficient and error free. It aims at standardizing data, consolidating data ensuring data integrity 
      and reducing inconsistencies. </p>
